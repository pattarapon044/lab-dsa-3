This github project is just created for people who want to improve yourself

### before going

1. Download work file on lms.
2. Clone this repository to your java eclipse editor.
3. You have to read work file before complete your code because I wrote everything follow that.

## Excercise

### To complete file

```
Directory : src/lab/sll/exercise
```

1. Exercise 1 : **SLL1.java**
2. Exercise 2 : **SLL2.java**
3. Exercise 3 : **SLL3.java**

### To check file

You have to run check these file because these are main in your exercises. The output of program of each files must be the same as example in your work file (lms).

```
Directory : src/lab/sll/main
```

1. For Exercise 1 : **MainSLL1.java**
2. For Exercise 1 : **MainSLL2.java**
3. For Exercise 1 : **MainSLL3.java**

### Your choice

If you run check and every thing is ok (every outputs are the same as example in work file (lms) ), you don't have to go to this part. But if you want to try you can.

- These files for run test

```
Directory : src/lab/sll/test
```
1. For Exercise 1 : **testSLL1.java**
2. For Exercise 1 : **testSLL2.java**
3. For Exercise 1 : **testSLL3.java**

### To do
1. Complete your code in method that have **TODO** comment inside from SLL1 to SLL2 to SLL3, because these 3 are following concept from each other.
2. During edit your code, you can run check for each exercise until the result is the same as example in work file.
3. After you complete each exercise you have to copy inside the class and paste in **SLL.java** at the bottom from recent line of code (do not have to delete old code)

### More description
1. After finish exercise1 copy code inside class SLL1 and paste it inside class SLL form file **SLL.java**. After that copy everything in SLL file and paste it to your work file.
2. After finish exercise2 copy code inside class SLL2 and paste it to SLL file again at the bottom (Do not delete code from exercise1). After that copy everything in SLL file and paste to your work file at exercise2.
